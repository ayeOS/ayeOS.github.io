My name is Matthew. I work as an iOS developer at [Kotikan](http://kotikan.com). I like code, maths and music. I also like writing. This blog will contain some of all of those things.

The site is written using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and the theme is [Polar Bear](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme), by [Camille Diez](http://diezcami.github.io/).
